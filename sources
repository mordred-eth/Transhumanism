I publish a curated list of links at my blog every Friday.  Some people were curious about where I find my information, so I decided to list my sources here.  Curating content is an ongoing process; expect this page to change frequently as I find higher-quality sources and eliminate lower-quality sources.  If you have any suggestions for good transhumanism resources, please share!
