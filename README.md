# Transhumanism

I publish a curated list of links at my blog every Friday.  Some people were curious about where I find my information, so I decided to list my sources here. 

Curating content is an ongoing process; expect these lists to change frequently as I find higher-quality sources and eliminate lower-quality sources.  If you have any suggestions for good transhumanism resources, please share!

I've also created a curated list of Twitter accounts relevant to transhumanism [here](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1474061794595512328?s=20&t=6-5PnnmoYcQ34W5Dwy_sGw).  Everything I said above applies to this list too; if you have any suggestions for good Twitter accounts to follow, feel free to message me and I'll add them.
